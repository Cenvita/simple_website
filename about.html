            <h2>Sobre mí</h2>

                    <p> Hello, my name is Roberto. My capabilities in my maximum exponent are: 
                        I'm a detective like Siesta, as well as charismatic, positive, mischievous, 
                        good person like Chisato, as fast as Tracer, explosive as a Creeper,
                        strong character like Zero Two, as creative and funny, playful as Tet, 
                        mysterious as Sombra or Dazai.(I can also be considered lazy by the graph reflected in how much studies), 
                        adrenaline as Lucio, vigilante as Aiden Pearce or Oliver Queen, 
                        controlling or dominant as Makima, Sora (I use it for good, so here it is 
                        countered by the personality of Siesta and Chisato), if we transform the 
                        physical strength or power of Saitama, Giorno and Sans in psychological + 
                        communication + ego + determination + (arrogance usually in good sense) is 
                        the equivalent that I possess, the madness of Yumeko and Ayanokouji or Shiba,
                        regarding being able to make a great plan and at the same time having made 
                        those roles in a way that nobody will notice anything out of the ordinary,
                        but I do it for a good purpose. The figure that represents me is the experimental polygon,
                        which allows me to have certain advantages over the rest, due to my knowledge 
                        about human behavior and the empathy I have about each of the roles. I lack constancy,
                        discipline and some knowledge outside of leisure + entertainment, my intention
                        is to strengthen these points. (As I said repeatedly, I don't want trust from anyone,
                        I can fail, plus it seems logical to me that people will approach you if you are 
                        well and otherwise not. I literally respect it, since in one case you contribute
                        while in the other you don't, laws of survival, besides I have the power to be 
                        with whomever I want if it's for entertainment or play, I don't mind solitude 
                        either, since I enjoy reading or doing activities that don't require people 
                        from the outside). My only disadvantage regarding this is the energy boost, 
                        it stimulates me a lot some pleasures, but I don't give a damn about it,
                        since it doesn't make me suffer. Here are some examples of characters,
                        but there are other skills that are comparable to other existing ones
                        not mentioned above, even the same ones, others that are similar but 
                        have a little change, I just don't want to make it too long and because
                        I do what I want, 
                        so I leave it here,
                        as a base guide.
